# Navigating Highways

• Focused on optimizing the algorithm for finding the best route from point A to point B by car, emphasizing reduction of time and 
space complexity. 

• Incresed navigation efficiency by refining time complexity through Valgrind with Callgrind option, reduced route calculations less 
than 1 second 

• Addressed memory leaks and optimized spatial complexity using AddressSanitizer and Valgrind with Memcheck option, 
ensuring a maximum memory usage of 1.2 MByte during route planning.
